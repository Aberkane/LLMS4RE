# Adopting Large Language Models for GDPR Compliance in User Stories

## Abstract
_Purpose:_ Ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a crucial yet challenging aspect of requirements engineering (RE), particularly when user stories must reflect legal constraints. Professionals often struggle to evaluate GDPR compliance due to the regulation’s complex legal language and the limited availability of resources and expertise. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support GDPR compliance assessment in user stories and investigates the factors that influence professionals’ willingness to adopt such tools. _Methods:_ A two-stage research design was employed. First, an experiment compared the GDPR compliance evaluations of four state-of-the-art LLMs with those of an expert panel across 33 user stories. Second, a survey of 51 RE and IT-law professionals, based on an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), was conducted to explore determinants of LLM adoption, including perceived trust, usefulness, and ease of use. _Results:_ Three of the four investigated LLMs produced GDPR evaluations that did not differ significantly from expert assessments, demonstrating promising alignment. Adoption indicators show growing interest, with 25.5\% of respondents using LLMs to analyze user stories and 21.6\% to evaluate GDPR compliance. Five of seven TAM-based hypotheses were supported, revealing that perceived usefulness and trust are the strongest predictors of behavioral intention to use LLMs for this task. _Conclusion:_ The findings show that LLMs can meaningfully support GDPR compliance evaluation in RE by providing consistent assessments and accessible explanations. However, given the potential risks associated with incorrect or overly confident model outputs, expert oversight remains essential. LLMs should therefore be applied as complementary tools that assist—but never replace—professional judgment in privacy-sensitive contexts.
